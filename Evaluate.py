Please evaluate the following outline:

Here's `Outline A`:
```
{_Outline1}
```

Use the following criteria to evaluate `Outline A`:

* Plot: Does the story have a coherent plot? Is it creative?
* Chapters: Do the chapters flow into each other (be very careful when checking this)? Do they feel connected? Do they feel homogenized or are they unique and fresh?
* Style: Does the writing style help move the plot or is it distracting from the rest of the story? Is it excessively flowery?
* Dialogue: Is the dialogue specific to each character? Does it feel in-character? Is there enough or too little?
* Tropes: Do the tropes make sense for the genre? Are they interesting and well integrated?
* Genre: Is the genre clear?
* Narrative Structure: Is it clear what the structure is? Does it fit with the genre/tropes/content?

Assign a score from 1-10 for each criterion for each, with 1 being the lowest and 10 being the highest. Provide a brief justification for your ratings.

Now, evaluate the other outline:

Here's `Outline B`:
```
{_Outline2}
```

Use the following criteria to evaluate `Outline B`:

* Plot: Does the story have a coherent plot? Is it creative?
* Chapters: Do the chapters flow into each other (be very careful when checking this)? Do they feel connected? Do they feel homogenized or are they unique and fresh?
* Style: Does the writing style help move the plot or is it distracting from the rest of the story? Is it excessively flowery?
* Dialogue: Is the dialogue specific to each character? Does it feel in-character? Is there enough or too little?
* Tropes: Do the tropes make sense for the genre? Are they interesting and well integrated?
* Genre: Is the genre clear?
* Narrative Structure: Is it clear what the structure is? Does it fit with the genre/tropes/content?
